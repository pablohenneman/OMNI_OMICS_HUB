## Section Results

### Critical Mistakes To Prevent
Pass Rate: 4/8 (50%)

[PARTIAL] Reinventing wheels
Evidence: Notes reuse of existing testthat scaffold and avoids nested project folder, but no explicit reuse guidance for manifest helpers yet. (Lines 82-83)
Impact: Risk of duplicating helpers without clear reuse direction.

[PASS] Wrong libraries
Evidence: Stack versions listed and no dependency updates required. (Lines 56-61)

[PASS] Wrong file locations
Evidence: Explicit file locations for domain, persistence, service, and tests. (Lines 63-68)

[PARTIAL] Breaking regressions
Evidence: Tests listed, but no explicit regression guard for recent-projects list or routing after create/open. (Lines 31-34, 41-42)
Impact: UI/session regressions could slip through.

[PARTIAL] Ignoring UX
Evidence: Actionable error requirement is present, but no explicit UX flow guidance for create/open surfaces. (Lines 15-16)
Impact: UI could diverge from UX patterns (primary action, error copy consistency).

[PASS] Vague implementations
Evidence: Tasks/subtasks are concrete and scoped to specific helpers and behaviors. (Lines 20-34)

[N/A] Lying about completion
Evidence: Story file is a plan, not an implementation artifact.

[PASS] Not learning from past work
Evidence: Prior story intelligence included with actionable reuse guidance. (Lines 82-83)

### Exhaustive Analysis Required
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Exhaustive analysis requirement
Evidence: Validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Utilize Subprocesses / Subagents
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Use subagents
Evidence: Validator instruction, not applicable to story content.

### Competitive Excellence
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Competitive excellence mandate
Evidence: Validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Step 1: Load and Understand the Target
Pass Rate: 0/6 (0%)

[N/A] Load workflow configuration
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load story file
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load validation framework
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Extract metadata (epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title)
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Resolve workflow variables
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Understand current status
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

### Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis
Pass Rate: 3/5 (60%)

[PARTIAL] Epics and stories analysis
Evidence: Story requirements and ACs are included, but no broader epic context or dependencies. (Lines 13-16, 97)
Impact: Cross-story dependencies may be under-specified.

[PARTIAL] Architecture deep-dive
Evidence: Architecture boundaries referenced, but not fully enumerated. (Lines 40-54, 63-68)
Impact: Some architecture nuances may be missed.

[PASS] Previous story intelligence
Evidence: Prior story learnings included. (Lines 82-83)

[PASS] Git history analysis
Evidence: Git intelligence summary included. (Lines 85-87)

[PASS] Latest technical research
Evidence: Latest versions and sources included for golem, bslib, and renv. (Lines 56-61, 89-93)

### Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
Pass Rate: 1/5 (20%)

[PARTIAL] Reinvention prevention gaps
Evidence: Reuse of testthat scaffold noted, but no explicit reuse of manifest helper patterns beyond this story itself. (Lines 82-83)
Impact: Potential for redundant helpers if not coordinated.

[PARTIAL] Technical specification disasters
Evidence: Atomic writes and schema validation are required, but edge cases (existing folder collisions, permissions, locked files) are not explicitly specified. (Lines 22-30, 45-47)
Impact: Unsafe create/open behavior if edge cases are not handled.

[PASS] File structure disasters
Evidence: Explicit file locations and module/service/persistence boundaries. (Lines 63-68)

[PARTIAL] Regression disasters
Evidence: Tests listed, but no explicit requirement to preserve recent-projects list or routing state after create/open. (Lines 31-34, 41-42)
Impact: UI regressions could slip through.

[PARTIAL] Implementation disasters
Evidence: Actionable errors are required, but detailed error UX for create/open failures is not specified. (Lines 15-16, 27-30)
Impact: Inconsistent error handling across failure modes.

### Step 4: LLM Dev Agent Optimization Analysis
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

[PASS] Verbosity problems
Evidence: Story is concise and task-focused. (Lines 7-34)

[PASS] Ambiguity issues
Evidence: Requirements and tasks are explicit and scoped. (Lines 13-34)

[PASS] Context overload
Evidence: Context is limited to relevant constraints. (Lines 36-100)

[PASS] Missing critical signals
Evidence: Path resolver, atomic writes, and schema versioning are explicit. (Lines 45-47)

## Failed Items

None.

## Partial Items

- Reinventing wheels
- Breaking regressions
- Ignoring UX
- Epics and stories analysis
- Architecture deep-dive
- Reinvention prevention gaps
- Technical specification disasters
- Regression disasters
- Implementation disasters

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: None
2. Should Improve: Add explicit edge-case handling for folder collisions, permissions/locked files, and recent-projects/routing preservation after create/open.
3. Consider: Add brief UX notes for create/open flows (primary action, error copy elements) to align with UX spec patterns.
