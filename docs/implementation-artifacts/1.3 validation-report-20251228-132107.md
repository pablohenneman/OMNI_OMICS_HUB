- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Critical Mistakes To Prevent
Pass Rate: 6/8 (75%)

[PASS] Reinventing wheels
Evidence: Explicit reuse of manifest validation and path resolver helpers from Story 1.2. (Lines 51-52)

[PASS] Wrong libraries
Evidence: No new libraries required and stack constraints noted. (Lines 61-64)

[PASS] Wrong file locations
Evidence: Explicit file locations for services, persistence, UI, and tests. (Lines 66-69)

[PARTIAL] Breaking regressions
Evidence: Additional tests added, but no explicit regression guard for active project routing beyond tests. (Lines 35-39, 33-36)
Impact: Deletion could still regress UI routing if not covered in implementation.

[PASS] Ignoring UX
Evidence: Explicit confirmation modal and detailed copy requirements. (Lines 23-25)

[PASS] Vague implementations
Evidence: Tasks/subtasks specify concrete responsibilities and file locations. (Lines 22-40, 66-69)

[N/A] Lying about completion
Evidence: Story file is a plan, not an implementation artifact.

[PASS] Not learning from past work
Evidence: Prior story intelligence is included with actionable reuse context. (Lines 82-85)

### Exhaustive Analysis Required
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Exhaustive analysis requirement
Evidence: This is a validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Utilize Subprocesses / Subagents
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Use subagents
Evidence: Validator instruction, not applicable to story content.

### Competitive Excellence
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Competitive excellence mandate
Evidence: Validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Step 1: Load and Understand the Target
Pass Rate: 0/6 (0%)

[N/A] Load workflow configuration
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load story file
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load validation framework
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Extract metadata (epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title)
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Resolve workflow variables
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Understand current status
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

### Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis
Pass Rate: 2/5 (40%)

[PARTIAL] Epics and stories analysis
Evidence: Story requirements and ACs included; no full epic context beyond story-level details. (Lines 13-18, 93-95)
Impact: Cross-story dependencies may be under-specified.

[PARTIAL] Architecture deep-dive
Evidence: Architecture constraints and boundaries are referenced but not fully enumerated. (Lines 40-70)
Impact: Some architectural nuances may be missed.

[PASS] Previous story intelligence
Evidence: Prior story learnings included. (Lines 82-85)

[PASS] Git history analysis
Evidence: Git intelligence summary is included. (Lines 87-89)

[PARTIAL] Latest technical research
Evidence: Notes that no web research was performed. (Lines 91-93)
Impact: Latest version changes may be missed.

### Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
Pass Rate: 2/5 (40%)

[PASS] Reinvention prevention gaps
Evidence: Explicit reuse guidance provided. (Lines 51-52)

[PARTIAL] Technical specification disasters
Evidence: Technical requirements cover path resolver and deletion sequencing but not full safety edge cases like open handles beyond task-level note. (Lines 29-30, 48-50)
Impact: Risk of unsafe deletion edge cases if not enforced in code.

[PASS] File structure disasters
Evidence: Explicit file locations and boundaries provided. (Lines 66-69)

[PARTIAL] Regression disasters
Evidence: Regression tests added, but no explicit requirement to preserve UI routing behavior described. (Lines 35-39)
Impact: Regressions could slip in routing or selection state.

[PARTIAL] Implementation disasters
Evidence: Tasks are defined but error messaging detail beyond confirmation is limited. (Lines 26-31)
Impact: Error UX could be underspecified for diverse failures.

### Step 4: LLM Dev Agent Optimization Analysis
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

[PASS] Verbosity problems
Evidence: Story is concise and task-focused. (Lines 7-40)

[PASS] Ambiguity issues
Evidence: Requirements and tasks are explicit and scoped. (Lines 13-40)

[PASS] Context overload
Evidence: Context is limited to relevant constraints. (Lines 40-93)

[PASS] Missing critical signals
Evidence: Confirmation copy requirements and reuse guidance are explicit. (Lines 23-25, 51-52)

## Failed Items

None.

## Partial Items

- Breaking regressions
- Epics and stories analysis
- Architecture deep-dive
- Latest technical research
- Technical specification disasters
- Regression disasters
- Implementation disasters

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: None
2. Should Improve: Add explicit requirement to preserve active-project routing and selection state, and specify minimum error UX copy elements for deletion failures.
3. Consider: Include a brief note on soft-lock behavior if project is currently open in another session/process.
