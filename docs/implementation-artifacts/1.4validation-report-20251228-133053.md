- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Critical Mistakes To Prevent
Pass Rate: 6/8 (75%)

[PASS] Reinventing wheels
Evidence: Reuse manifest validation patterns from Story 1.2/1.3. (Lines 55, 88-89)

[PASS] Wrong libraries
Evidence: No dependency updates required and renv changes explicitly disallowed. (Lines 54, 97)

[PASS] Wrong file locations
Evidence: Explicit file locations for services, persistence, UI, and tests. (Lines 69-74)

[PARTIAL] Breaking regressions
Evidence: Tests are listed, but no explicit requirement to preserve routing/selection state beyond active workspace note. (Lines 36-40, 83-84)
Impact: Regressions could slip into UI selection/routing behavior if not covered in implementation.

[PASS] Ignoring UX
Evidence: Explicit confirmation copy and button hierarchy requirements. (Lines 24-25, 65-67)

[PASS] Vague implementations
Evidence: Tasks/subtasks specify concrete responsibilities and file locations. (Lines 21-40, 69-74)

[N/A] Lying about completion
Evidence: Story file is a plan, not an implementation artifact.

[PASS] Not learning from past work
Evidence: Prior story intelligence and reuse guidance included. (Lines 86-89)

### Exhaustive Analysis Required
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Exhaustive analysis requirement
Evidence: Validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Utilize Subprocesses / Subagents
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Use subagents
Evidence: Validator instruction, not applicable to story content.

### Competitive Excellence
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

[N/A] Competitive excellence mandate
Evidence: Validator instruction, not a story requirement.

### Step 1: Load and Understand the Target
Pass Rate: 0/6 (0%)

[N/A] Load workflow configuration
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load story file
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Load validation framework
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Extract metadata (epic_num, story_num, story_key, story_title)
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Resolve workflow variables
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

[N/A] Understand current status
Evidence: Validator process instruction.

### Step 2: Exhaustive Source Document Analysis
Pass Rate: 2/5 (40%)

[PARTIAL] Epics and stories analysis
Evidence: Story requirements and ACs are included, but no broader epic context or dependencies. (Lines 13-17, 101)
Impact: Cross-story dependencies may be under-specified.

[PARTIAL] Architecture deep-dive
Evidence: Architecture boundaries and persistence rules are referenced but not fully enumerated. (Lines 57-74)
Impact: Some architectural nuances may be missed.

[PASS] Previous story intelligence
Evidence: Prior story learnings included. (Lines 86-89)

[PASS] Git history analysis
Evidence: Git intelligence summary included. (Lines 91-93)

[PARTIAL] Latest technical research
Evidence: Notes that no web research was performed. (Lines 95-97)
Impact: Latest version changes may be missed.

### Step 3: Disaster Prevention Gap Analysis
Pass Rate: 2/5 (40%)

[PASS] Reinvention prevention gaps
Evidence: Explicit reuse guidance provided. (Lines 55, 88-89)

[PARTIAL] Technical specification disasters
Evidence: Path resolver and atomic write requirements are covered, but edge cases (workspace in use, locked files) are not explicitly required. (Lines 52-55, 83-84)
Impact: Risk of unsafe lifecycle behavior if edge cases are not handled in implementation.

[PASS] File structure disasters
Evidence: Explicit file locations and boundaries provided. (Lines 69-74)

[PARTIAL] Regression disasters
Evidence: Regression tests are listed but do not explicitly cover routing/selection state beyond active workspace note. (Lines 36-40, 83-84)
Impact: UI regressions could slip through.

[PARTIAL] Implementation disasters
Evidence: Error UX is mentioned but not detailed for all failure modes (e.g., open handles, permission errors). (Lines 24-25, 65-67)
Impact: Error handling could be inconsistent across failure cases.

### Step 4: LLM Dev Agent Optimization Analysis
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

[PASS] Verbosity problems
Evidence: Story is concise and task-focused. (Lines 7-40)

[PASS] Ambiguity issues
Evidence: Requirements and tasks are explicit and scoped. (Lines 13-40)

[PASS] Context overload
Evidence: Context is limited to relevant constraints. (Lines 42-104)

[PASS] Missing critical signals
Evidence: Confirmation copy, path resolver, and atomic write requirements are explicit. (Lines 24-25, 52-55)

## Failed Items

None.

## Partial Items

- Breaking regressions
- Epics and stories analysis
- Architecture deep-dive
- Latest technical research
- Technical specification disasters
- Regression disasters
- Implementation disasters

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: None
2. Should Improve: Add explicit requirement for workspace-in-use/locked-file errors and for preserving workspace selection/routing state after create/open/delete.
3. Consider: Add explicit note on recent-workspaces UI list update order (update only after successful persistence).
